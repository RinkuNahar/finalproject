The university was originally conceived to be built as the first cultural university in Bangladesh, but the JKKNIU Act enacted in 2006 made it a general university with a special focus on liberal-cum-performing arts education and research.The university has a duly qualified and productive band of youthful faculty members and officers/staffs who are deeply committed to the university's mission to produce world class graduates in academic disciplines of arts, social sciences, science & engineering, and business administration - whose services and dedications are urgently needed for the reconstruction of this country.
